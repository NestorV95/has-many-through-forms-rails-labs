Create a form at posts#new to create a new post. The form should include check boxes
for us to select categories as well as a text field to create a new category. You 
should do this with a nested form so that our controller stays thin. Also, typing in 
a Category name that already exists should not create a new category. Instead, if we 
type in a category that already exists, we should select it from the database and 
associate the post we've created with the existing category.

When creating new comments, we should only create a new user if they filled in that 
input. accepts_nested_attributes_for has a reject_if option that you can configure 
to only create new records if all the fields aren't blank.



Also, the select box that we use for the users needs to have a blank option –– check 
out the include_blank option for collection_select.

<%= form_for @post do |f| %>
    <%= f.label :title %>
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
    <%= f.label :content %>
    <%= f.text_field :content %>
    <%= f.collection_check_boxes :categoy_ids, Category.all, :id, :name %>
    <%= f.fields_for :categories, post.categories.build do |c| %>
        <%= c.text_field :name %>
    <%end%>
    <%= f.submit %>
<%end%>
